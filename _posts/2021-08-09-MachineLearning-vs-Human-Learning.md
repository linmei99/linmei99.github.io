title: Machine Learning vs Human Learning
---

After finishing my project utilizing several common Machine Learning algorithms, I cannot help but started thinking, how did people come up with these stuff? Each of the most commonly used ML algorithms, like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Tree, Neutral Network, share so little in common, other than that the fact that they all works to some degree.

In the end, the only thing I can come up with, is that the creators of these algorithms probably modeled them after their own personal learning model.

This is machine learning from people at its most basic form. Condensing human methods of learning into concret, well defined steps, and have machines follow the steps. On the other hand, can human learn from machines in exactly the same format?

The Gradient Boosted Tree, in its execution, is basically the same as the most commonly seen software testing procedure. In software testing, you start with unit testing, once this passed, you go through integration test, where several modules interact together. Then system level testing, etc... Each layer of testing is just like how each of the gradient boosted tree is built. Each tree is built to minimize the difference between the actual output and the expected output. Each layer of testing is to complete a part of the whole test suite, until all the tests are covered. The Six Sigma process in business management is essentially GBM (Gradient Boosting Machines) executed in human action terms, instead of using computer code.

The early stop condition of the GBM, is to stop the models if the evaluation set is not improving, while the training error continue to reduce, and training set results continue to improve. If you apply this to how product development and testing goes, it indicates that the product needs to be given to the end user and see how it functions. If the errors seem by the end users are not improving, continue to enhance the product according to the original defined specifications is not helpful at all.

Putting it in another way, the Agile software development process that are being widely spread in the last decade, is much closer to the GBM than the earlier model of software development process. So, you can say that the business process followed by human organizations, are improving and adapting at the same speed as machine learning algorithm are improving.

So, the question is, who is learning from whom? Who is the chicken and who is the egg here? Did people copy working principles from human learning experience, and convert them into ML (Machine Learning) algorithms, or did people learn from the most proven ML algorithms and adapt them? Or they just co-develop together, without anyone introduce the two different development process to each other?

The more I look, the more similarities between human organizating principles and proven ML algorithms can be found.

I would say that the Random Forest (RF) model of machine learning, is essentially converted from a democratic voting process into computer code. Each of the tree in a Random Forest model use only a subset of total features. In human terms, each of the voter is only required to have a partial knowledge of the entire political scene. In this sense, we do not require the voters to be well educated on all political aspects at all, before they are granted the right to vote. In fact, if everyone have the same knowledge, it would just become an echo chamber, and everyone would say exactly the same thing and every tree would produce the exactly same outcome.

Of course, it does not mean any tree can be included in a RF. Each of the tree still must be grown to minimize the cost function, given its limited set of features.  

After these are all said, an interesting question naturally arises. Could we use proven ML lagorithm to guide how human learns from this world? Can people improve their personal learning model, their decision process, by applying proven ML concpets?

Food for thoughts for the day.
